# Simplified Portuguese Language Specification

## Locale

Currently, we're using `pt-qaaa` to specify this Simplified Portuguese: `pt` comes from `Portuguese` itself, and `qaaa` comes from special locale codes used for [private use only](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_15924#Special_codes). Once it gets real, we may apply an official locale to ISO standard.

## Active Simplified Portuguese Language Rules

For now, nothing has been simplified yet.

## Test Corpus

For now, there's no Corpus for testing new rules

## Contributing

If you want to help simplifying the Portuguese Language:

- open an issue (in English or Traditional Portuguese) to discuss a change and/or improvement proposal and its underlying implications
- open a pull request updating this README.md with the proposed rules, and/or with updated and added tests in our corpus
